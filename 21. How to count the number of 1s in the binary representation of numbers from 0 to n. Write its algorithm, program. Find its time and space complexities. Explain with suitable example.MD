Algorithm (Optimized Approach)
Key Insight:
The problem can be solved efficiently by recognizing a pattern in the binary representation of numbers. Instead of iterating over each number and counting the 1s individually, we can use an efficient approach that leverages dynamic programming.

Steps:
Initialization:

We will use an array dp[] where dp[i] stores the number of 1s in the binary representation of the number i.
dp[i] can be derived from the formula:
dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
Where i >> 1 is the number i shifted right by 1 (which is the number without its least significant bit), and (i & 1) checks if the least significant bit is 1.
Iterate from 1 to n:

For each number i, compute the number of 1s using the formula above and add it to a running total.
Return the Result:

The total number of 1s for numbers from 0 to n is the sum of dp[0] to dp[n].
 Java Program
public class CountOnesInBinary {

    public static int countOnes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all numbers from 0 to n
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            // Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of i
            count += Integer.bitCount(i);
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println("Count of 1s in binary representations from 0 to " + n + ": " + countOnes(n));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
n = 5
Process:
We need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of numbers from 0 to 5.
Binary Representations:

0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 10
3 -> 11
4 -> 100
5 -> 101
Count of 1s in each binary number:

0: 0 1s
1: 1 1
2: 1 1
3: 2 1s
4: 1 1
5: 2 1s
Total Count of 1s:

0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7
 Output:
Count of 1s in binary representations from 0 to 5: 7
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the input number. We loop from 0 to n and use the Integer.bitCount() function for each number, which has a time complexity of O(1) due to the number of bits being constant (32-bit integers).

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results and the total count. The space required does not grow with n.
