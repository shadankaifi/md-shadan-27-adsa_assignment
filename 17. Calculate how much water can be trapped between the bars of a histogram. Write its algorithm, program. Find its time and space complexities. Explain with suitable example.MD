Algorithm (Two-pointer Approach)
Key Insight:
The amount of water that can be trapped above a bar depends on the minimum of the maximum heights of the bars to its left and right. If we know the maximum height to the left and right of each bar, we can easily calculate the amount of water trapped above it.

Steps:
Two pointers:

Start with two pointers: one at the leftmost bar (left) and one at the rightmost bar (right).
Maintain two variables, leftMax and rightMax, which store the maximum heights encountered so far from the left and the right, respectively.
Move the pointers towards the center:

If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, calculate the water trapped at the left pointer:
If height[left] is greater than or equal to leftMax, update leftMax with height[left].
Otherwise, water can be trapped at height[left], and the amount of trapped water is leftMax - height[left].
If the height at the right pointer is less than or equal to the height at the left pointer, calculate the water trapped at the right pointer:
If height[right] is greater than or equal to rightMax, update rightMax with height[right].
Otherwise, water can be trapped at height[right], and the amount of trapped water is rightMax - height[right].
Continue moving the pointers until they meet.

Return the total amount of trapped water.

 Java Program
public class TrappingRainWater {

    public static int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
        int totalWater = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                } else {
                    totalWater += leftMax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                } else {
                    totalWater += rightMax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }

        return totalWater;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] height = {0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1};
        System.out.println("Total trapped water: " + trap(height));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Process:
Initialization:

left = 0, right = 11, leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, totalWater = 0.
Step-by-step traversal:

Move left pointer: At height[0], height[left] = 0, no water trapped (since leftMax = 0).
Move left pointer: At height[1], height[left] = 1, update leftMax = 1, no water trapped.
Move left pointer: At height[2], height[left] = 0, water trapped = 1 - 0 = 1, totalWater = 1.
Move left pointer: At height[3], height[left] = 2, update leftMax = 2, no water trapped.
Move left pointer: At height[4], height[left] = 1, water trapped = 2 - 1 = 1, totalWater = 2.
Move left pointer: At height[5], height[left] = 0, water trapped = 2 - 0 = 2, totalWater = 4.
Continue similarly until all bars are processed.
Final total trapped water: totalWater = 6.

 Output:
Total trapped water: 6
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We traverse the array only once using two pointers.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the leftMax, rightMax, and totalWater variables.
