 Algorithm (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is an efficient algorithm to solve the majority element problem. It works in two phases:

Phase 1: Candidate Selection:

Start with a candidate and a count initialized to 0.
Traverse the array:
If count is 0, set the candidate to the current element and set count = 1.
If the current element is equal to candidate, increment count by 1.
If the current element is not equal to candidate, decrement count by 1.
After this phase, the candidate will be the majority element (if it exists).
Phase 2: Verification (optional in some cases):

If you want to verify the majority element, traverse the array again and count how many times the candidate appears.
If it appears more than n / 2 times, it's the majority element.
 Java Program
public class MajorityElement {

    public static int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = -1, count = 0;

        // Phase 1: Find the candidate
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
                count = 1;
            } else if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Phase 2: Verify the candidate (optional, since the problem guarantees the majority element)
        int occurrences = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == candidate) {
                occurrences++;
            }
        }

        return occurrences > nums.length / 2 ? candidate : -1;  // Return -1 if no majority element exists
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Majority Element: " + majorityElement(nums));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
nums = [3, 2, 3]
Process:
Phase 1: Candidate Selection

Start with candidate = -1, count = 0.
Traverse through the array:
At element 3: count = 0, so set candidate = 3, count = 1.
At element 2: count != 0, candidate = 3, so decrement count to 0.
At element 3: count = 0, so set candidate = 3, count = 1.
After Phase 1, the candidate is 3.
Phase 2: Verification (optional)

Count occurrences of 3: It appears 2 times in the array, which is more than n / 2 (3 / 2 = 1.5). So, the majority element is 3.
 Output:
Majority Element: 3
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We only traverse the array twice (once for candidate selection and once for verification).
Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the candidate and count variables.
