➕ Find Two Numbers in a Sorted Array That Add Up to a Target
✅ Problem Statement
Given a sorted array arr[] of integers and a target sum target, find two distinct numbers in the array whose sum equals the target.

🧠 Algorithm (Two-Pointer Technique)
Since the array is sorted, we can solve this efficiently using the two-pointer technique:

Initialize two pointers:

One pointer left starts at the beginning (0 index).
The other pointer right starts at the end (n-1 index).
While left pointer is less than right:

Calculate the sum of arr[left] + arr[right].
If the sum equals the target, return the pair of numbers.
If the sum is less than target, move the left pointer rightward to increase the sum.
If the sum is greater than target, move the right pointer leftward to decrease the sum.
If no such pair is found, return null or indicate that no pair exists.

💻 Java Program
public class TwoSumInSortedArray {

    public static int[] findTwoSum(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];

            if (sum == target) {
                return new int[]{arr[left], arr[right]};  // Found the pair
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;  // Move left pointer to the right
            } else {
                right--;  // Move right pointer to the left
            }
        }

        return null;  // No pair found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        int target = 10;

        int[] result = findTwoSum(arr, target);
        if (result != null) {
            System.out.println("Pair found: " + result[0] + ", " + result[1]);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No pair found.");
        }
    }
}
📌 Example
Input:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
target = 10
Process:
left = 0, right = 7 → Sum = 1 + 8 = 9 (less than 10), move left to 1.
left = 1, right = 7 → Sum = 2 + 8 = 10 (match, return pair: 2, 8).
✅ Output:
Pair found: 2, 8
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time complexity is O(n) because we only make one pass through the array using two pointers.
Space complexity is O(1) since we're only using two pointers and not extra space for a result set.
📚 Summary
The two-pointer technique works perfectly with sorted arrays, allowing us to efficiently find a pair that adds up to a target sum. It's faster than the brute force approach which would require O(n²) time. This technique is widely applicable in problems involving pairs or sums in sorted data, such as in search engines or numeric algorithms.
