Algorithm
Key Insight:
For any given number of digits n, the first digit must be from 1 to 9, and the subsequent digits can be selected from the remaining digits (with no repetition).

The approach is based on counting the possible numbers for each digit-length, considering the constraint of unique digits.

Steps:
Base Case:

If n = 0, return 1 (there is exactly one number with 0 digits, i.e., the empty number).
If n = 1, return 10 (the numbers 0 through 9 are valid).
General Case:

For n > 1, calculate the number of valid numbers for each k digits (where k ranges from 1 to n).
For each k-digit number:
The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
The second digit can be any of the remaining 9 digits (0 to 9, excluding the first digit).
The third digit can be any of the remaining 8 digits, and so on.
Multiply the possibilities for each digit position to find the total number of unique k-digit numbers.
Return the Total:

Sum the valid numbers for all lengths from 1 to n.
 Java Program
public class UniqueDigitNumbers {

    public static int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;  // There is exactly one number with 0 digits, the empty number.

        int result = 10;  // For n = 1, there are 10 numbers (0 through 9)
        int currentProduct = 9;  // For the first digit (choices from 1 to 9)
        int availableDigits = 9; // Number of available digits for the remaining places

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            currentProduct *= availableDigits;  // Multiply by available digits for the current position
            availableDigits--;  // Decrease the pool of available digits
            result += currentProduct;  // Add to the result
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;
        System.out.println("Count of numbers with unique digits for " + n + " digits: " 
            + countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
n = 3
Process:
For n = 1:

Numbers are 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, so the count is 10.
For n = 2:

First digit: 9 choices (1, 2, 3, ..., 9).
Second digit: 9 choices (0, 1, 2, ..., 9 excluding the first digit).
Total: 9 * 9 = 81 numbers.
For n = 3:

First digit: 9 choices (1, 2, 3, ..., 9).
Second digit: 9 choices (0, 1, 2, ..., 9 excluding the first digit).
Third digit: 8 choices (since two digits are used already).
Total: 9 * 9 * 8 = 648 numbers.
Final Result:

Total numbers with unique digits for n = 3: 10 (for n=1) + 81 (for n=2) + 648 (for n=3) = 739.
 Output:
Count of numbers with unique digits for 3 digits: 739
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of digits. We loop through all digit lengths from 2 to n, performing constant-time operations inside the loop.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results and do not use any additional data structures that grow with n.
