🧠 Algorithm (Iterative Approach)
Initialize a dummy node to act as a placeholder for the result.
Use a current pointer to build the merged list.
Compare the values of the two lists (l1 and l2):
Attach the smaller node to the current pointer.
Move the pointer of the list from which the node was taken.
Once one list is exhausted, append the remaining nodes from the other list.
Return the merged list starting from the node after the dummy node.
💻 Java Program
public class MergeSortedLists {

    public static class ListNode {
        int val;
        ListNode next;
        ListNode(int val) {
            this.val = val;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    public static ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        // Dummy node to act as a placeholder for the result list
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = dummy;

        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val < l2.val) {
                current.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                current.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        // Attach the remaining nodes from the non-null list
        if (l1 != null) {
            current.next = l1;
        } else {
            current.next = l2;
        }

        return dummy.next;  // Return the merged list
    }

    // Helper function to print the list
    public static void printList(ListNode head) {
        while (head != null) {
            System.out.print(head.val + " ");
            head = head.next;
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating two sorted lists
        ListNode l1 = new ListNode(1);
        l1.next = new ListNode(2);
        l1.next.next = new ListNode(4);

        ListNode l2 = new ListNode(1);
        l2.next = new ListNode(3);
        l2.next.next = new ListNode(4);

        // Merging two sorted lists
        ListNode mergedList = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);

        // Printing merged list
        System.out.print("Merged List: ");
        printList(mergedList);
    }
}
📌 Example
Input:
l1 = [1, 2, 4]
l2 = [1, 3, 4]
Process:
Start with two pointers, l1 and l2, initialized at the heads of the lists.
Compare the first elements: 1 (from l1) and 1 (from l2). Both are equal, so attach the first 1 from l1 to the result list and move the l1 pointer.
Now compare 2 (from l1) and 1 (from l2). Attach 1 from l2 to the result list and move the l2 pointer.
Continue comparing the next elements and add them in sorted order: 2, 3, 4, 4.
After the second list (l2) is exhausted, attach the remaining 4 from l1.
✅ Output:
Merged List: 1 1 2 3 4 4
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n + m)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two linked lists. We iterate through both lists once.
Space Complexity: O(1), because we are modifying the linked lists in place (no additional space is used except for the result linked list).
