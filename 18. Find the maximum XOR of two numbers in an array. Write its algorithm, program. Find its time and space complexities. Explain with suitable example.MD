Algorithm (Trie-based Approach)
Key Insight:
The problem can be solved efficiently using a Trie (prefix tree), which helps in quickly finding the maximum XOR pair by comparing binary prefixes of the numbers.
Steps:
Construct a Trie of Binary Numbers:

Each number in the array is represented as a 32-bit binary number (assuming 32-bit integers).
Insert each number into the Trie, bit by bit, from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
XOR Maximization:

For each number in the array, traverse the Trie to find the number that gives the maximum XOR. This is done by always trying to pick the opposite bit (to maximize the XOR result).
Final Result:

Keep track of the maximum XOR encountered during the traversal.
 Java Program
class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[2];
}

public class MaximumXOR {

    private static final int BIT_LENGTH = 32;

    // Insert a number into the trie
    private static void insert(TrieNode root, int num) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (int i = BIT_LENGTH - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (node.children[bit] == null) {
                node.children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[bit];
        }
    }

    // Find the maximum XOR for a given number
    private static int findMaxXOR(TrieNode root, int num) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        int maxXor = 0;
        for (int i = BIT_LENGTH - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            int oppositeBit = 1 - bit;
            if (node.children[oppositeBit] != null) {
                maxXor |= (1 << i);
                node = node.children[oppositeBit];
            } else {
                node = node.children[bit];
            }
        }
        return maxXor;
    }

    public static int findMaximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        int maxXor = 0;

        // Insert each number into the trie
        for (int num : nums) {
            insert(root, num);
        }

        // Find the maximum XOR for each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxXor = Math.max(maxXor, findMaxXOR(root, num));
        }

        return maxXor;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8};
        System.out.println("Maximum XOR: " + findMaximumXOR(nums));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
nums = [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
Process:
Binary Representation of each number (32-bit representation):

3   = 00000000000000000000000000000011
10  = 00000000000000000000000000001010
5   = 00000000000000000000000000000101
25  = 00000000000000000000000000011001
2   = 00000000000000000000000000000010
8   = 00000000000000000000000000001000
Trie Construction:

We insert each number into the Trie bit by bit from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.
Finding Maximum XOR:

For each number, we try to find the opposite bit to maximize the XOR value:
For 3, the maximum XOR is with 25, resulting in 28.
For 10, the maximum XOR is with 5, resulting in 15.
For 5, the maximum XOR is with 25, resulting in 28.
For 25, the maximum XOR is with 5, resulting in 28.
For 2, the maximum XOR is with 25, resulting in 28.
For 8, the maximum XOR is with 25, resulting in 28.
Final Result:

The maximum XOR is 28.
 Output:
Maximum XOR: 28
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time (Insert)	O(n * BIT_LENGTH)
Time (Find Max XOR)	O(n * BIT_LENGTH)
Space	O(n * BIT_LENGTH)
Time Complexity:

Inserting each number into the Trie takes O(BIT_LENGTH) time, where BIT_LENGTH = 32 (for 32-bit integers).
Finding the maximum XOR for each number takes O(BIT_LENGTH) time as well.
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n * BIT_LENGTH), where n is the number of elements in the array and BIT_LENGTH is 32.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(n * BIT_LENGTH), as we store n numbers in the Trie, each requiring BIT_LENGTH space for its binary representation.
