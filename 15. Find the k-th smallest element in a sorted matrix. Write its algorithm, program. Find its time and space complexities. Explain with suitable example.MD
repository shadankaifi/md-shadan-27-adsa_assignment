üß† Algorithm (Binary Search Approach)
Key Insight:
The matrix is sorted both row-wise and column-wise, which can help us efficiently find the k-th smallest element using binary search.
Steps:
Set up binary search bounds:

The smallest possible element is at the top-left corner of the matrix (matrix[0][0]).
The largest possible element is at the bottom-right corner of the matrix (matrix[n-1][n-1]).
Use binary search between the smallest and largest element:

Set low = matrix[0][0] and high = matrix[n-1][n-1].
Count elements less than or equal to the mid value:

For each row, use binary search to count how many elements are less than or equal to the mid value.
Adjust the binary search bounds:

If the count of elements less than or equal to mid is less than k, it means the k-th smallest element is greater than mid. So, move low to mid + 1.
If the count is greater than or equal to k, it means the k-th smallest element is less than or equal to mid. So, move high to mid.
Continue the binary search until low equals high, at which point low will be the k-th smallest element.

üíª Java Program
public class KthSmallestElementInMatrix {

    public static int countLessEqual(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int count = 0;
        int row = n - 1;
        int col = 0;

        // Traverse the matrix from bottom-left
        while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
            if (matrix[row][col] <= target) {
                count += (row + 1);  // All elements in this column are <= target
                col++;
            } else {
                row--;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static int kthSmallest(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int low = matrix[0][0], high = matrix[n - 1][n - 1];

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = countLessEqual(matrix, mid);

            if (count < k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 5, 9},
            {10, 11, 13},
            {12, 13, 15}
        };

        int k = 8;
        System.out.println("The " + k + "-th smallest element is: " + kthSmallest(matrix, k));
    }
}
üìå Example
Input:
matrix = [
    [1, 5, 9],
    [10, 11, 13],
    [12, 13, 15]
]
k = 8
Process:
Initial bounds: low = 1, high = 15.

Binary search:

Calculate mid = (1 + 15) / 2 = 8.
Count the number of elements ‚â§ 8: count = 6.
Since 6 < 8, move low to mid + 1 = 9.
New bounds: low = 9, high = 15.

Binary search:

Calculate mid = (9 + 15) / 2 = 12.
Count the number of elements ‚â§ 12: count = 7.
Since 7 < 8, move low to mid + 1 = 13.
New bounds: low = 13, high = 15.

Binary search:

Calculate mid = (13 + 15) / 2 = 14.
Count the number of elements ‚â§ 14: count = 8.
Since 8 >= 8, move high to mid = 14.
Final bounds: low = 14, high = 14. The 8th smallest element is 14.

‚úÖ Output:
The 8-th smallest element is: 14
‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n * log(max-min)))
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: The binary search takes O(log(max-min)) iterations, where max is the largest element and min is the smallest element in the matrix. For each iteration, the countLessEqual function takes O(n), where n is the number of rows (or columns). So, the overall time complexity is O(n * log(max-min)).
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
