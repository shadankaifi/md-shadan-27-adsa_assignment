🧠 Algorithm (Next Permutation)
The steps to find the next greater permutation are as follows:

Find the pivot: Traverse the array from right to left to find the first element that is smaller than the element next to it (i.e., arr[i] < arr[i + 1]). This element is called the pivot.

Find the successor: From the end of the array, find the smallest element that is greater than the pivot (i.e., arr[j] > arr[i]).

Swap: Swap the pivot and successor elements.

Reverse the suffix: Reverse the part of the array that comes after the pivot's original position to get the smallest possible arrangement.

If no such pivot is found, the array is sorted in descending order, and we return the smallest permutation by sorting the array.

💻 Java Program
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NextPermutation {

    public static void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int i = nums.length - 2;
        
        // Step 1: Find the first decreasing element
        while (i >= 0 && nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
            i--;
        }
        
        if (i >= 0) {
            // Step 2: Find the element to swap with
            int j = nums.length - 1;
            while (nums[j] <= nums[i]) {
                j--;
            }
            
            // Step 3: Swap the elements
            swap(nums, i, j);
        }
        
        // Step 4: Reverse the suffix
        reverse(nums, i + 1);
    }

    private static void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }

    private static void reverse(int[] nums, int start) {
        int left = start, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            swap(nums, left++, right--);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        nextPermutation(nums);
        System.out.println("Next permutation: " + Arrays.toString(nums));
    }
}
📌 Example
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
Process:
Find pivot: The first decreasing element is 2 at index 1.
Find successor: The smallest element greater than 2 is 3 at index 2.
Swap: Swap 2 and 3, resulting in [1, 3, 2].
Reverse suffix: Reverse the part after index 1, but it's already sorted, so the final result is [1, 3, 2].
✅ Output:
Next permutation: [1, 3, 2]
Input:
nums = [3, 2, 1]
Process:
Find pivot: No pivot is found since the array is in descending order.
Return smallest permutation: The smallest permutation is [1, 2, 3].
✅ Output:
Next permutation: [1, 2, 3]
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. We are traversing the array a few times, each linear in complexity.
Space Complexity: O(1) because no additional space is used except for a few variables (in-place modification).
