Algorithm (Bit Manipulation)
Key Insight:
A number is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one 1 bit in its binary representation. This property can be checked using the following trick:

For a number n to be a power of two: The expression n & (n - 1) should be equal to 0 and n must be greater than 0.

n & (n - 1) clears the lowest set bit of n, and if the result is 0, it means that n has only one 1 bit in its binary representation.
Steps:
Check if n is greater than 0: If n <= 0, then it cannot be a power of two.
Apply the bit manipulation trick: Check if n & (n - 1) == 0. If true, then n is a power of two.
Return the result: Return true if n is a power of two, otherwise false.
 Java Program
public class PowerOfTwo {

    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // A number is a power of two if it is greater than 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 16;
        System.out.println("Is " + n + " a power of two? " + isPowerOfTwo(n));
    }
}
 Example
Input:
n = 16
Process:
Check if n > 0: Since n = 16, it is greater than 0, so we proceed to the next step.
Apply the bit manipulation trick:
n = 16, so n - 1 = 15.
n & (n - 1) becomes:
16 (binary: 10000)
& 15 (binary: 01111)
---------------
0 (binary: 00000)
Since the result is 0, n is a power of two.
Return the result: The function returns true.
 Output:
Is 16 a power of two? true
Input:
n = 18
Process:
Check if n > 0: Since n = 18, it is greater than 0, so we proceed.
Apply the bit manipulation trick:
n = 18, so n - 1 = 17.
n & (n - 1) becomes:
18 (binary: 10010)
& 17 (binary: 10001)
---------------
16 (binary: 10000)
Since the result is not 0, n is not a power of two.
Return the result: The function returns false.
 Output:
Is 18 a power of two? false
⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
Operation	Complexity
Time	O(1)
Space	O(1)
Time Complexity: O(1), as the bitwise operations n & (n - 1) and the comparison are done in constant time.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables.
